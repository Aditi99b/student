## Aditi Bharadwaj's Blog 
Hi! My name is Aditi Bharadwaj and I'm a sophmore. I'm so excited to be taking CSP this year and I hope to learn a lot about coding! I had some setbacks in the beginning about installing the applications and getting them to work. For example, I installed WSL but had an error with my username. Because of this, I got the prompt of "root" instead of "home". I solved this problem by reinstalling Ubuntu on my computer and redoing the username and password. Now my WSL works fine. I also had some issues uploading my image, but I tried to solve the problem logically and I got it to work now! Overall, I had some setbacks but I'm happy to know that all of my applications are working good now!

## Overview of Hacks, Study and Tangibles
Blogging in GitHub pages is a way to learn and code at the same time. 

- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.
