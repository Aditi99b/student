## Aditi Bharadwaj's Blog 
Hi! My name is Aditi Bharadwaj and I'm a sophmore. I'm so excited to be taking CSP this year and I hope to learn a lot about coding! I had some setbacks in the beginning about installing the applications and getting them to work. For example, I installed WSL but had an error with my username. Because of this, I got the prompt of "root" instead of "home". I solved this problem by reinstalling Ubuntu on my computer and redoing the username and password. Now my WSL works fine. I also had some issues uploading my image, but I tried to solve the problem logically and I got it to work now! Overall, I had some setbacks but I'm happy to know that all of my applications are working good now!
